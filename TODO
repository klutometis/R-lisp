* TODO zip should preserve names
* DONE zip.list with one list is broken
  CLOSED: [2010-03-09 Tue 19:05]
  - CLOSING NOTE [2010-03-09 Tue 19:05] \\
    have to do an explicit check for one list, apparently; not tested with zip.c.
  #+BEGIN_SRC R
    source('package.R')
    library(RUnit)
    
    checkEquals(zip.list(list(1, 2)),
                list(1, 2),
                'zip on a monadic list')
  #+END_SRC
